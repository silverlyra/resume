# Lyra’s résumé

Hello! This is the source code for my software engineering résumé.

I started writing in it plain HTML in a fit of GeoCities-era nostalgia, but when that desire faded, I put it together with [Next.js][next] and [TypeScript][ts]. It’s served [on the web][prod] via [CloudFlare Pages][cfp].

[next]: https://nextjs.org/
[ts]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
[prod]: https://lyra.engineer/
[cfp]: https://pages.cloudflare.com/

## Making changes

Oh, hi, are you me? Here to update the professional credentials? No problem; start the [Next.js][next] dev server with:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Changes pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub will be deployed automatically.
